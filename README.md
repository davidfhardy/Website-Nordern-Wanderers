# Nordern Wanderers Website Content
This website is a travel blog style website. Raphael Mabalot and I started this brand, Nordern Wanderers,
to document our adventures (e.g. road trips) and use it as a platform to showcase our photography. 

You can view our website at `http://nordernwanderers.com/`

# Tools
I used the Atom text editor to implement the code for the site. 

## HTML
The main pages for the site are stored in the main directory. The blog posts about specific locations
are stored in the adventures folder. 

## CSS and Bootstrap
To make the website responsive, I used Bootstrap 4, flexbox, and media queries. 
All the CSS is stored at `css/styles.css`.

## PHP
The process.php file in the main directory allows users to directly send us emails
through the website.

## Javascript
Javascript was used to add functionality to buttons throughout the website. All javascript
files are stored in the `js/` folder.
